# Zone Air Update Map

Reference version: EnergyPlus 26.1.0

Purpose: define what must be ported before an official ExampleFile zone air
temperature series can be promoted with `conformance_claim=true`.

## Source Anchors

| EnergyPlus area | Source anchor | Rust target | Current status |
|---|---|---|---|
| zone predictor/corrector driver | `src/EnergyPlus/ZoneTempPredictorCorrector.cc` | `advance_heat_balance_state_one_timestep` successor | scalar shell only |
| mean air temperature histories | `MAT`, `XMAT`, `XM2T`, `XM3T`, `ZoneAirTemp` | `ZoneHeatBalanceState::previous_mean_air_temperatures_c` | placeholder history |
| air capacitance | zone volume, multipliers, moist-air density and specific heat | `ZoneHeatBalanceState::air_heat_capacity_j_per_k` plus psychrometric helper shell | active lane still uses simple constant density/cp; EnergyPlus `PsyRhoAirFnPbTdbW`/`PsyCpAirFnW` helper is unit-checked but not wired |
| internal convective gains | `InternalHeatGains.cc` | `simulate_zone_internal_convective_gains`, heat-balance gain input | convective gain case only |
| surface convection coupling | `HeatBalanceSurfaceManager.cc` | future surface convection aggregate | not ported |
| HVAC and infiltration coupling | zone equipment and air balance managers | future zone load inputs | not ported |

## Promotion Requirements

An official ExampleFile zone-air series may become conformance only after:

- Rust computes the hourly series without reading EnergyPlus ESO values.
- warmup exclusion/inclusion is explicit and matches the report contract.
- zone timestep count, hourly reporting timestamp, and run-period dates match.
- all heat inputs used in the promoted case have source-map entries.
- failure deltas are below declared max absolute and RMSE tolerances.
- the case has a blocking gate and `conformance_claim=true`.

## Current Boundary

`Zone Mean Air Temperature` is conformance only for the declared no-mass local
cases. Official `1ZoneUncontrolled` zone temperature is a baseline and failing
diagnostic candidate. The diagnostic now records run-period filtering and
Rust/oracle warmup day metadata, but it remains below promotion until the
predictor/corrector histories, surface coupling, and warmup convergence match
EnergyPlus.

The EnergyPlus moist-air capacitance equations are available as runtime helpers,
but direct timestep wiring was intentionally held back. In the active
`1ZoneUncontrolled` dynamic diagnostic lane, using timestep-interpolated
outdoor humidity as a proxy for `airHumRat` worsened the floor heat-storage RMSE
from the previous `108.672323` focus value to `143.623752`, with zone inside
aggregate conduction rising to `99.724533`. Port `ZoneAirHumRat` ownership and
the predictor/corrector update order before enabling moist-air capacitance in
the active solver path.

The current third-order coupled probe is a useful candidate, not a promotion.
On the frozen-hconv interleaved grey-longwave surface lane it lowers MAT RMSE
to `0.069817 C` and floor heat-storage RMSE to `54.593582 W`, but the latent
`Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate` and `Zone Air Heat Balance Air
Energy Storage Rate` rows rise to `29.623453 W` and `29.666388 W` RMSE. Keep
the next zone-air work on source-order parity and owned moist-air capacitance,
not on a standalone temperature-solver swap.

A non-frozen-hconv third-order sibling confirms that the latent air-balance
regression is not solved by simply unfreezing hconv. It nudges MAT and the two
latent zone-air RMSE rows to `0.069191 C`, `28.637227 W`, and `28.446243 W`, but
raises the current floor heat-storage/inside-conduction/outside-conduction rows
to `58.289839 W`, `33.704368 W`, and `24.970278 W`. That keeps the next
zone-air target on coefficient/source ordering rather than a different hconv
cadence.

A weather-proxy moist-air storage report fork then isolates the storage side of
that regression. It leaves the frozen third-order MAT and floor RMSE rows
unchanged, but lowers `Zone Air Heat Balance Air Energy Storage Rate` RMSE from
`29.666388 W` to `5.845285 W`; `Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate`
stays at `29.623453 W`. This points the remaining latent zone-air work at
surface convection source-order/coefficient timing, while proper zone
`airHumRat` ownership remains required before promoting the moist-air capacity
formula into the active solver.

A previous-MAT surface-convection report probe was added to test whether the
remaining zone surface-convection row was using `ZTM[0]` rather than corrected
MAT as the reference air temperature. It is a rejected path: the MAT/floor/air
storage rows are unchanged, but `Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate`
RMSE rises from `29.623453 W` to `104.589141 W`. Keep the next work on
`SurfTempInTmp`/hconv/source-order parity instead of changing the report
reference to previous MAT.

A balance-closure surface-convection report probe narrows the same latent row
without changing the active solver path. In the no-load/no-infiltration
`1ZoneUncontrolled` diagnostic, reporting surface convection as
`CzdTdt - SumIntGains` leaves MAT, floor rows, and weather-proxy air storage
unchanged while lowering `Zone Air Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate` RMSE
from `29.623453 W` to `19.203798 W`. Keep this as source-isolation evidence
only: EnergyPlus reports the direct `SumHADTsurfs` surface sum, so the
remaining work is still `SurfTempInTmp`/hconv/source-order parity plus owned
zone humidity before any conformance promotion.

A frozen-reference-air surface-solve probe improves the zone state but exposes
the remaining coupled-source trade-off. Holding the surface pass reference air
at the timestep-start MAT while still correcting zone air after each pass lowers
MAT RMSE from `0.069817 C` to `0.031508 C` and the mass-floor face-temperature
RMSEs from about `0.0534 C` to about `0.0322 C`. The latent zone-air rows
regress, though: balance-closure surface convection rises from `19.203798 W` to
`21.039586 W`, and weather-proxy air storage rises from `5.845285 W` to
`7.495999 W`. This makes frozen surface reference air a useful cadence clue,
not a standalone promotion path.

A current-pass interior-longwave sibling was added on top of frozen reference
air after source rechecking EnergyPlus' CTF-only inside loop. It leaves the
zone-air picture essentially unchanged: MAT nudges from `0.031508 C` to
`0.031507 C`, but surface convection remains `21.039633 W` and weather-proxy
air storage remains `7.496023 W`. The next zone-air work is therefore still
`SurfTempInTmp`/hconv/source-order parity plus owned zone humidity, not
longwave sampling cadence alone.

Adding the EnergyPlus inside-surface convergence cutoff to that same lane
improves MAT slightly (`0.031507 C` to `0.030867 C`) and lowers the floor and
aggregate conduction rows, but it does not solve the latent zone-air rows:
surface convection rises to `21.105254 W` and weather-proxy air storage rises
to `7.547299 W`. Keep the convergence cutoff as a source-aligned surface
cadence candidate, while the next zone-air work remains the explicit
`SurfTempInTmp`/hconv report path and owned humidity/capacitance.

On the promoted ScriptF-flat, 20-iteration lane, a surface-reference-air report
probe separates the surface report snapshot from the zone-air `SumHADTsurfs`
path. Using each surface's stored inside-solve reference air improves individual
`Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Gain Rate` rows, but it worsens `Zone Air
Heat Balance Surface Convection Rate` from `22.062956 W` to `91.956638 W` RMSE.
This means the surface `SurfQdotConvInRep` reference-air snapshot is useful
source evidence, but the zone AirRpt surface-convection row still needs the
EnergyPlus `CalcZoneComponentLoadSums` timing mapped separately.

A final-hconv report sibling then tested whether EnergyPlus' reported
`SurfHConvInt` could be approximated by recomputing TARP from the final
`SurfTempIn` and report reference air while keeping the solver frozen. It is
also a rejected report path: zone surface convection RMSE worsens from
`22.062956 W` to `24.513143 W`, and floor inside convection heat gain worsens
from `13.602803 W` to `16.742712 W`. The remaining zone-air surface convection
gap is therefore not solved by either surface-refair reporting or final
hconv-only reporting.

An inside-CTF report sibling then tested whether the aggregate conduction rows
should use the outside-temperature snapshot consumed by the last inside CTF
solve. It leaves MAT, surface convection, air storage, floor storage, and
individual floor conduction unchanged, but worsens zone opaque aggregate
conduction from `18.143612 W` to `22.208305 W` inside and from `11.590547 W` to
`12.785602 W` outside. The zone-air/aggregate report path therefore still needs
EnergyPlus advanced report timing mapped separately from the surface CTF solve
snapshot.

A zone surface-report aggregate sibling then summed per-surface conduction
report helpers for the zone opaque aggregate rows, matching the EnergyPlus
`UpdateThermalHistories` aggregate shape. It is neutral: MAT, surface
convection, air storage, zone inside/outside aggregate conduction, and floor
storage all retain the active ScriptF-flat RMSE values (`0.037329 C`,
`22.062956 W`, `9.127258 W`, `18.143612 W`, `11.590547 W`, and `28.786920 W`).
The next zone-air work therefore stays on `CalcZoneComponentLoadSums` timing,
`SurfTempInTmp`/hconv ownership, and upstream surface/source/history parity
rather than on a zone aggregate accumulator source swap.

The dynamic probe summary now also tracks zone surface-convection report
closure against the signed sum of individual
`Surface Inside Face Convection Heat Gain Rate` rows (`zone + surface_sum`). On
the active ScriptF-flat lane the six-surface closure has oracle RMSE
`67.733212 W`, Rust RMSE `30.140119 W`, and residual-delta RMSE `47.307560 W`.
Because EnergyPlus itself does not close this surface-report sum to zero, the
remaining `SumHADTsurfs` work should stay on EnergyPlus
`CalcZoneComponentLoadSums` timing, `SurfTempInTmp`, and
`getInsideAirTemperature`/hconv ownership rather than directly summing surface
report heat-gain rows.
