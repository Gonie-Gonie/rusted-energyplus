# Project Contract

The locked oracle is EnergyPlus 26.1.0. The Rust core remains Rust-only and
does not change engineering algorithms in compatibility mode.

The machine-readable contract is `specs/project_contract.toml`.

## Mode Meanings

- `compatibility`: EnergyPlus source-order algorithm path. This is the only
  path that can produce compatibility evidence.
- `diagnostic`: compatibility functions plus extra instrumentation or probes.
  It may explain deltas, but it is not conformance evidence.
- `partial`: explicitly allowed supported subset execution. It is ad-hoc and
  never sets `conformance_claim=true`.
- `fast` and `experimental`: implementation experiments. Their results are not
  compatibility evidence.

## Allowed Optimization

Compatibility-safe optimization is limited to Rust representation, typed IDs,
precompute/cache, deterministic execution planning, output handles,
trace throttling, diagnostics, result storage, and numerical implementation
inside declared tolerance.

## Forbidden Compatibility Changes

Compatibility mode must not introduce new engineering algorithm variants,
timestep semantic changes, setpoint-manager timing changes, plant dispatch
semantic changes, or delta-tuned probes as candidate algorithms.

## Claim Requirements

A conformance claim requires:

```text
case manifest
+ declared variables or meters
+ tolerance rules
+ EnergyPlus oracle baseline
+ Rust result artifact
+ compare-summary.json
+ compare-report.md
+ blocking gate
```

Markdown wording, smoke tests, diagnostics, arbitrary IDF runs, and performance
results do not create compatibility claims.

## Full-Domain Claims

Heat-balance, HVAC, plant, and time full-domain claims use canonical
required-routine lists in `specs/project_contract.toml`. A domain can be
claimed only when its routine inventory is explicitly complete and every
listed routine is `family_gated` or `complete` in
`specs/algorithm_ledger.toml`. Limited algorithm conformance does not satisfy
this rule. Full runtime compatibility remains locked until all EnergyPlus
domains have complete inventories.

The [algorithm ledger](../../../specs/algorithm_ledger.toml) owns each
routine's source symbol, required flag, completion status, bounded state
contract, and remaining exclusions. [Capabilities](../../../specs/capabilities.toml)
own the supported input/runtime combinations and forbidden active features.
Generated catalogs and source maps make those records navigable; repeated
historical checkpoint prose is not additional evidence.

Source maps retain durable routine/state ownership and source-order details:
[heat balance](../porting-map/heat-balance-source-map.md),
[zone air](../porting-map/zone-air-update-map.md), and
[IdealLoads](../porting-map/ideal-loads-source-map.md). Implementations follow
the [source-faithful porting plan](../../../energyplus_porting_plan/README.md)
without changing these claim requirements.

## Run States

Arbitrary runs return one of three support states:

- `run_blocked`: unsupported active semantics prevent Rust execution.
- `partial_supported_run`: unsupported or inactive items were ignored by an
  explicit rule and the result is ad-hoc only.
- `supported_compatibility_run`: all active objects and algorithms match
  declared capabilities and the run completed inside compatibility mode.
